Hello, my name is Enrique also known as Horuss, I am a highly motivated and ethical professional with a strong commitment to protecting organizations from cyber threats. My core values integrity, loyalty, and a passion for safeguarding people drive my dedication to cybersecurity. I am eager to continuously learn about evolving attack vectors and implement proactive measures to defend against them.

With a detail oriented and organized mindset, I excel at maximizing the effectiveness of existing security tools to fortify organizations against threats. My primary focus is on the defensive side of cybersecurity, ensuring systems remain resilient against attacks. However, I also recognize the importance of offensive security techniques in strengthening overall defenses. By understanding both sides of the equation, I aim to create a well-rounded approach to cybersecurity.

I am seeking an opportunity to contribute my skills and dedication to a cybersecurity team where I can grow, learn, and actively support the protection of digital assets against emerging threats.

I’m currently learning Python and everything I can absorve related to cyber security.

I like video games a lot, I used to work in the esports industry and I play almost anything I can get my hands on these days.
